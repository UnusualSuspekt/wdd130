            <p>Hi. My name is Wyatt Ross and I am a human being. I am currently 22 years old and living in southern Alberta. I have only been here for about 6 years, but I still like it quite like it. Some of my biggest accomplishments to date include the rank of Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts of America, black belt in Kenpo karate, graduating highschool, and serving a mission. One day I hope to become an airline pilot and fly for a company such as Air Canada, WestJet, or Delta, depending on where I live.</p>

            <p>Canada is very diverse in national parks, cities, and temperatures. Although it is known to be very cold, some parts of Canada are rather warm, such as Toronto, Ontario. It is home to some of the most beautiful landscapes in North America.</p>
